## Grant's Dotfiles

This is a fork from Le Wagon's dotfiles. [Here is their whole computer setup](github.com/lewagon/setup). Default to those instructions. Covers 99% of what I use. I've added a bit.

## Requirements
Mac

## Setting up the terminal:
1. Run:
```
zsh install.sh
```

2. Open terminal preferences. Sync settings to the root folder of this repository.

## Grants Casks

Run:
```
./install_casks.sh
```
