## Grant's Dotfiles

This is a fork from Le Wagon's dotfiles. [Here is their whole computer setup](github.com/lewagon/setup). Default to those instructions. Covers 99% of what I use. I've added a bit.

## Requirements
Mac

## Setting up the terminal:
Run:
```
zsh install.sh
```

open terminal preferences and install the file ending in `.terminal`

## Toolset

- [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
