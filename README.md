## Grant's Dotfiles

This is a fork from Le Wagon's dotfiles. [Here is their whole computer setup](github.com/lewagon/setup). Default to those instructions. Covers 99% of what I use. I've added a bit.

## Requirements
Mac

## Setting up the terminal:
1. Run:
```
zsh install.sh
```

2. Open terminal preferences. Navigate to profiles and import the file ending in `.terminal`. Set set terminal to open up using it and set as default.
